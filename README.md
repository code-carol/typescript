# üíª TypeScript

[Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

TypeScript is a programming language that allows us to write JavaScript with a set of tools called a type system that can spot potential bugs in, clarify the structure of, and help refactor our code.

     <h2>‚≠êÔ∏è How to use it</h2>
   </summary>
  
### 1.

We write TypeScript code in files with the extension `.ts`.

### 2.

We run our code through the TypeScript transpiler. The transpiler will check that the code adheres to TypeScript‚Äôs standards, and it will display errors when it does not.

TypeScript transpiler can be used on the command line by running the `tsc` command.

### 3.

If the TypeScript code can be converted into working JavaScript, the transpiler will output a JavaScript version of the file (.js).

     <h2>‚≠êÔ∏è Type Inference</h2>
   </summary>

When we declare a variable with an initial value, the variable can never be reassigned a value of a different data type.

```
let order = 'first';

order = 1;
```

Error: `Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.`

   <summary>
     <h2>‚≠êÔ∏è Type Shapes</h2>
   </summary>

TypeScript knows what types our objects are, it also knows what shapes our objects adhere to. An object‚Äôs shape describes, among other things, what properties and methods it does or doesn‚Äôt contain.

```
"OH".length; // 2
"MY".toLowerCase(); // "my"
```

```
"MY".toLowercase();
// Property 'toLowercase' does not exist on type '"MY"'.
// Did you mean 'toLowerCase'?
```

</details>

<details>
   <summary>
     <h2>‚≠êÔ∏è Type Any</h2>
   </summary>

Variables of type `any` can be assigned to any value and TypeScript won‚Äôt give an error if they‚Äôre reassigned to a different type later on.

```
let onOrOff;

onOrOff = 1;
onOrOff = false;
```

   <summary>
     <h2>‚≠êÔ∏è Type Annotations</h2>
   </summary>

We can declare a variable and the type of the variable without an initial value.

We provide a type annotation by appending a variable with a colon `(:)` and the type (e.g., number, string, or any).

```
let mustBeAString : string;
mustBeAString = 'Catdog';

mustBeAString = 1337;
// Error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'
```

     <h2>‚≠êÔ∏è The tsconfig.json File</h2>
   </summary>

The `tsconfig.json` file is always placed in the root of your project and you can customise what rules you want the TypeScript compiler to enforce.

Create the file with `tsc --init` command.

```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2017",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "outDir": "./build",
    "noUnusedLocals": true
  },
  "include": ["**/*.ts"]
}
```

In the JSON, there are several properties:

- "compilerOptions", which is a nested object that contains the rules for the TypeScript compiler to enforce.

- "target", the value "es2017" means the project will be using the 2017 version of EcmaScript standards for JavaScript.

- "module", this project will be using "commonjs" syntax to import and export modules.

- "strictNullChecks", variables can only have null or undefined values if they are explicitly assigned those values.

- "include" that determines what files the compiler applies the rules to. In this case ["**/*.ts"] means the compiler should check every single file that has a .ts extension.

- "outDir" add the js files to a folder in your directory

- "noUnusedLocals" shows all the variables that are not being used
